            <p>Giap Nguyen founded Straight to the Point Archery in 2005 after becoming dissatisfied with the local archery education options in Tacoma for his three children. 
                A skilled archer who competed with the U.S. Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics.
                Nguyen's business grew significantly following the release of The Hunger Games series, which sparked a rise in archery interest, especially among young women.</p><br>
