            <p>Giap Nguyen founded Straight to the Point Archery in 2005 after becoming dissatisfied with the local
                archery education options in Tacoma for his three children.
                A skilled archer who competed with the U.S. Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics.
                Nguyen's business grew significantly following the release of The Hunger Games series, which sparked
                a
                rise in archery interest, especially among young women.</p><br>
            <p>Straight to the Point Archery is a nonprofit archery education center offering top-notch training and
                coaching.
                The facility features 28 shooting lanes, private coaching rooms, and access to additional lanes and
                an
                outdoor field.
                Catering to all skill levels, from beginners to professionals, they provide lessons, private
                classes,
                and various programs like youth events, corporate parties, and homeschool offerings.

                positive
                environment.
